The class will introduce the rationale of measuring change and stability over time to study phenomena, as well as how within-person designs can increase statistical power and precision compared to more traditional designs. Most the course will use multi-level models and latent (growth) curve models to specify patterns of change across time. Additional topics include: visualization, measurement invariance, time-to- event models and power. PREREQ: Use of R will be required, Familiarity with MLM and/or Structural Equation Models.\n\n**Class textbook** \n\nReadings will be provided\n\n**Grading** \n\nTBA\n\n**Schedule**\n\n| Week | Date  |  Topic                                                     | Readings             |\n-------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 1/17  | Motivation, terms, concepts and graphing                                 |                      |\n| 2    | 1/24  | Growth curves; MLM in R: packages and procedures       |                      |\n| 3    | 2/2   |  Conditional (Leve 1 and 2 predictors) MLM models     |                      |\n| 4    | 2/7   |  Polynomial, piecewise and spline models                    |        |\n| 5    | 2/14  |  Intensive data anlysis/within person fluctuations p1 |                      |\n| 6    | 2/21  |  Intensive data anlysis/within person fluctuations p2  |                      |\n| 7    | 2/28  |  Experimental approaches and 2 wave data  |                      |\n| 8    | 3/7   |  Dyadic Models                               |                      |\n| 9    | 3/14  | **Spring Break!**                     |                      |\n| 10   | 3/21  |  SEM and Latent Grown (curve) Models                     |                      |\n| 11   | 3/28  |  Scaling, MI, and Second order Model                 |                      |\n| 12   | 4/4   |  Multiple group models                        |                      |\n| 13   | 4/11  |  Flexible SEM models (LCM, STATE-TRAIT; ALT-SR)           |                      |\n| 14   | 4/18  |  Mixture Models                                       |                      |\n| 15   | 4/25  |  Biometric or Survival or ? or catch up       |                      |\n",
