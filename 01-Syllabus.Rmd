####People#### 
**Instructor**: Joshua Jackson  
**Office**: 315B  
**Office hours**: 10-11 Wednesday and by appointment  

**Course Descrition** 

This course covers modern methods of handling longitudinal, repeated measures. The class will introduce the rationale of measuring change and stability over time to study phenomena, as well as how within-person designs can increase statistical power and precision compared to more traditional designs. Most the course will use multi-level models and latent (growth) curve models to specify patterns of change across time. Additional topics include: visualization, measurement invariance, time-to- event models and power. PREREQ: Use of R will be required, Familiarity with MLM and/or Structural Equation Models.
